      <h2>I am a 13 year old boy. I live in a small country in north Africa, Tunisia. I study in Pioneer School of Menzah 5. I have a lot of real life and online friends. I've started programming since I was 12 years old. I currently program C++ and some HTML. No CSS or JS yet sadly. And that's all about me!</h2>

      <h1>Learning HTML</h1>
      <h2>I started learning HTML this week using a website called : "CodeAcedemy". You should check it out! It helped me learn how to make this current website! So i was just searching for the best websites to learn coding and then i found out about it. It was amazing! In only a small time of two hours, I've learnt the basics of HTML! Without that website, i could've never done this. Thank you CodeAcademy, and thank you to you, the reader, for reading this website!</h2>
